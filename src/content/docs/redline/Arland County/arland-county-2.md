### Arland County, North Carolina

A collapsed mine on land owned by the *Church of Revival and Trinity* has revealed a disturbing scene: five missing individuals discovered underground—**one dead from a gunshot wound**, and **four others found suffocated** in the rubble.

Emergency crews responded late Wednesday night after tips and drone footage pointed to unusual activity near the long-abandoned **Black Hollow Mine**, located deep in the forests east of Arland County. Though officially closed since the 1990s, the mine showed signs of recent reinforcement and electrical wiring, suggesting **active use**.

No records of permitted operations exist under the Church's name, yet land ownership records confirm the property is held by a private entity associated with the group.

### Grim Discovery Below Ground

Rescue teams navigating the collapsed shaft recovered five bodies—**all previously reported missing** over the past several weeks. One victim, identified as **Kyle Rowe, 27**, died from a **gunshot wound to the head**. The remaining four, three men and one woman, appeared to have **suffocated** after being trapped by the collapse.

Authorities are investigating whether the individuals were inside the mine voluntarily or being held there.

### Church Responds

When asked for comment, Pastor **Silas Creed** of the Church of Revival and Trinity responded with a brief, cryptic statement:

> “The earth sometimes swallows the faithless. Those who remain unawakened often meet the fate of darkness. The Awakened walk above ground.”

He offered no further details on the presence of the missing individuals or the mine’s use.

### Local Reaction

**Sheriff Jack Barnes** acknowledged the tragedy, stating:

> “This is a heartbreaking discovery. These were people from our own community. Mines like that aren’t safe for anyone. We’re doing everything we can to understand what happened.”

Sheriff Barnes declined to speculate on the Church’s involvement but confirmed that further inquiries are ongoing at the county level.
