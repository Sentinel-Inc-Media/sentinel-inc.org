> “This wasn’t just some blackout or emergency maintenance. I’ve worked these towers for 14 years, and I ain’t never seen anything like this.”

Earlier this week, an anonymous message accompanied by a grainy surveillance still was sent to our newsroom. The image, captured from a relay tower camera positioned in an elevated region, appears to show an unidentified armed operator—military-style gear, advanced optics, and no visible insignia. According to the sender, the footage was taken mere moments before a shutdown of the towers systems and apparent fire.

The source, who claims to be a contract technician responsible for maintaining radio tower equipment across the region, alleges that federal agents—identified only as “FBI facilitators”—had been systematically ordering local technicians to disable exterior cameras, power sources, and long-range relays.

Although there is no video or recordings of federal agents contacting this man, here is his statement:

> “They told us it was national security. That they had jurisdiction. But I’ve lived here all my life, and when our people go missing and no one’s allowed to ask questions? That’s not national security—that’s cover-up.”

The technician reports witnessing, via secondary internal feeds, the bodies of what appeared to be local civilians, who the anonymous informant reported to be incapacitated or possibly dead. Just out of frame, he says, were multiple similarly dressed operators moving in coordinated formations, with no identifying markings and no attempts to offer aid.

> “It ain’t a warzone. This is farm country, dammit. And now there’s men with rifles movin’ like ghosts through the night, and folks are endin’ up dead. If that don’t smell like a government hit job, I don’t know what does.”

Efforts to reach federal authorities for comment were met with the usual refrain: “No comment on ongoing operations.” When asked if the Bureau had knowledge of civilian casualties or unauthorized use of force, no further statements were given.

The image itself—while low resolution—has been forwarded to forensic analysts for metadata analysis. Preliminary results suggest the photo was indeed captured from a high-altitude, secured camera system owned by a private communications firm that has since denied any breach of protocol.

Locals near the region have also reported power surges, strange helicopter activity, and roadblocks manned by “out-of-town law enforcement” with unfamiliar badges.

For now, one thing is clear: something is happening deep in the woods of Arland County, and the people meant to protect us are the same ones cutting the cameras.
