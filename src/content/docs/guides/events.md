## Campaign

Sentinel missions tend to follow a campaign, curated by the Game Master(s). Some missions will not be considered canon and will be announced as such beforehand. Canon missions can advance the overall story of the campaign, and failures have the capacity to dramatically change the course of the campaign.

Sentinel campaigns tend to last for a set period of time, before a new location (game map) is chosen and a new campaign is begun.

## Operations vs Contracts

### Operations

Operations are normally bigger events, scheduled further out in time, and tend to have greater implications for the overall campaign.

Operations are posted/scheduled in the [`#operations`](https://discord.com/channels/1282118590568599695/1282140695574085652) channel in the discord.

### Contracts

Contracts are generally smaller, less impactful, events to the campaign. It is common that non-canon events take place within contracts, although not always.

Contracts are posted/scheduled in the [`#contracts`](https://discord.com/channels/1282118590568599695/1284120938287202324) channel in the discord.

:::note
Speaking of canon and non-canon... Occasionally, a non-canon event can become successful enough to create a new non-canon canon. Keep an eye out for the most enjoyable non-canon events and feel free to speak up if you want more canon for the non-canon canon!

:::caution
If you read that last note enough times, the word "canon" will start to look weird.
