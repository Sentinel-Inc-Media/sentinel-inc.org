## Pre-requisites

**Everyone in Sentinel MUST follow the [Rules and Regulations](/reference/rules-and-regulations)!**

## First Steps

### Step 1 - Joining

Join the Discord and complete the application via the Sentinel Main Computer. The application will ask the following questions:

- How did you hear about Sentinel Inc?
- How old are you?
- What is your gamertag?
- What timezone are you in?
- Do you have any prior milsim experience? (If so what games/unit)
- Are you a current/prior service member?
- Do you have any goals youâ€™d like to achieve in Sentinel, if so what are they?

### Step 2 - Completing Basic Training

Upon approval of your application, you'll be able to talk with our Drill Instructors to schedule a time for your [Basic Training](/guides/basic-training).

Basic Training typically takes approximately one hour or more to complete and covers essential skills including:

- Range qualification and weapons handling
- Team movement and bounding techniques
- Radio communication protocols
- Formation movement and road crossing procedures
- Land navigation and map reading
- CQB (Close Quarters Battle) and building clearing
- Vehicle dismount procedures

To successfully complete Basic Training, you'll need to pass the majority of these exercises. Don't worry if you're new to tactical gameplay - our instructors will guide you through each step of the process.

:::note
The [Recruit's Starter Kit](/reference/starter-kit) is required, and enforced, for all new recruits. Your [DI](/reference/terms#DI) should be able to assist you with preparing the kit.
:::

### Step 3 - Participate

Once you complete your Basic Training, you'll receive the password to the Arma Reforger server, and be notified when an [Operation](/reference/events#operations) or [Contract](/reference/events#contracts) (see [Operations vs Contracts](/reference/events/#operations-vs-contracts)) is scheduled via the [`#operations`](https://discord.com/channels/1282118590568599695/1282140695574085652) and [`#contracts`](https://discord.com/channels/1282118590568599695/1284120938287202324) Discord channels.

:::tip
Did those channel links not work for you? Make sure you've [joined our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Rm6AvU5J6t) and have access to those channels!
:::

### Step 4A - Rank Up and Spec Out

The more you participate, the higher you can go. After some time as a recruit, provided that you're active, you'll be promoted to an Operator. With each promotion, you get the ability to choose a [Specialty Position](/guides/specialties) that you'll be able to train into.

### Step 4B - Profit and Buy Gear

For every Operation or Contract you participate in, you'll receive a payout via the Sentinel Banking Operations bot. Sentinel has a built-in [Economy System](/guides/banking-operations) where you can purchase better guns, attachments, gear, and etc. The payouts are based on the success of the mission as well as your participation in the event.

:::tip
Save your earnings for specialized equipment that matches your chosen specialty path. Higher-tier equipment can significantly improve your effectiveness in the field!
:::

#### Loadout Management

Once you've purchased equipment, you can create and save multiple loadouts for different mission types. Your Drill Instructor can help you understand which equipment works best for different scenarios and specialties.
