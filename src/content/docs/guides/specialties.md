## Sentinel Specialist Positions

### Combat Roles

#### Rifleman
Standard infantry equipped with assault rifles and handguns. Typically appointed as pointman due to the universal capability of their weapons during CQB scenarios. Riflemen may use acquired munitions such as anti-vehicle weaponry if obtained during operations. After mission completion, all weaponry must be returned to the armory.

**Permitted Equipment:** Bacon M4 All Non-Specialized Variants

#### Combat Medic
Medics are entrusted with the care of their team and any other company personnel. They carry an excess of medical supplies including bandages, morphine, tourniquets, and other medical equipment. Medics must immediately treat wounded soldiers on the field to ensure their survival. During engagements, medics stay grouped with their squad to render aid immediately, increasing every company member's likelihood of survival. Equipped with a standard rifle and handgun, medics are not permitted to use alternative weapons unless absolutely necessary.

**Permitted Equipment:** Medic Box and Bacon M4

#### Anti-Tank Specialist
Permitted to use anti-tank weaponry during operations, including guided missile systems, unguided missile systems (RPGs), or anti-tank mines (can be placed by GM). May carry an RPG with excess rounds if the weapon is not single-shot, preferably armor-piercing rounds for effectiveness against tanks and AFVs. Other ammunition types may be used when the situation doesn't call for anti-tank capabilities, such as HE rounds against transport vehicles or large infantry groupings. Standard rifle and handgun are also permitted.

**Permitted Equipment:** SMAAW or Stinger launcher, anti-tank mines, and demo charges

#### Machine Gunner
Authorized to use belt-fed machine guns such as the M249 and similar approved weaponry. Permitted to carry a larger bag for excess LMG ammunition and a sidearm. Machine gunners should hold defensive positions or supporting positions during offensives, covering wide areas and assisting fellow company members with suppressing or direct fire. They should generally remain outside the main fire zone during assaults, staying in enclosed or safe positions to provide effective fire support.

**Permitted Equipment:** M240B Heavy Machine Gun

#### Designated Marksman
Unlike snipers, marksmen stay attached to their squad, providing longer-range support and more accurate fire to directly support their teammates. They assist in targeting HVTs such as gun emplacements, overwatch positions, and other problematic areas that typical riflemen may struggle to engage. Equipped with a high-strength optic, a designated marksman rifle, and a sidearm. If purchased, marksmen may carry a secondary assault rifle as a backup weapon.

**Permitted Equipment:** M21 (Restricted up to 6x)

#### Scout Sniper [TRAINING REQUIRED]
Snipers may operate independently from the main force during operations or reconnaissance when permitted. Equipped with a bolt-action or semi-automatic rifle and a standard sidearm. Snipers are the preferred class for reconnaissance missions and receive extensive training in evasion techniques and survival. They should only engage from secure locations and must immediately relocate if their position is compromised. Snipers can be equipped with rangefinders, ghillie suits, and other suitable equipment. They are permitted extended deployments away from the main fighting force to maximize effectiveness, targeting HVTs, gun emplacements, mortar crews, and other high-priority targets. Snipers should avoid direct close-range engagements unless authorized by command or deemed necessary by their professional judgment.

**Permitted Equipment:** M40A1

### Support Roles

#### Grenadier
Responsible for utilizing under-barrel or standalone grenade launchers to clear enemy positions such as fortified bunkers, dugouts, and groups of enemies in open spaces or tree lines. These launchers can also provide support through illumination, target marking with smoke, creating smoke cover, and other specialized functions. Grenadiers must master the versatility of their weapons and demonstrate proficiency with standard smoke and fragmentation grenades, carrying an excess of both.

**Permitted Equipment:** Bacon M4 M203 Specialized Variant

#### Radio Telephone Operator (RTO)
RTOs facilitate communication between teams and command, as well as requesting support such as air infiltration/exfiltration, artillery, and other battlefield necessities. They must maintain near-constant communication between command and team leaders while staying in close proximity to their unit. Equipped with standard infantry gear plus a radio backpack and headset for enhanced communication capabilities.

**Permitted Equipment:** Long range radio bag, Falcon IV

#### Combat Engineer
Engineers serve multiple functions on the battlefield, including combat construction of dugouts, dirt mounds for cover, and other quick defensive positions. They manage construction contracts and operations that support unit capabilities. Combat engineers may also handle sabotage, explosives, and minesâ€”placing charges to destroy positions and vehicles or deploying anti-personnel and anti-tank mines for defensive purposes. They function as standard riflemen with additional tools and supplies, potentially including mine detectors for clearing operations.

**Permitted Equipment:** LAW single use launcher, all variants of demolition block explosives/detonators, all building equipment (Sandbag, Camonet, Barbed Wire)

#### Media Team
