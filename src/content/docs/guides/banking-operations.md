Welcome to the Sentinel Banking Operations Guide. This document aims to provide information on everything you'll need to master the Sentinel Economy System.

### Making Money

1. When you successfully complete your Basic Training, you'll receive an initial payout to help get you started.

2. For every Operation or Contract you participate in, you'll receive a payout via the Sentinel Banking Operations bot. The payouts are based on the success of the mission as well as your participation in the event.

3. Additionally, you can work for a small pay periodically via the bot.

### Economy System Details

- **Mission Payouts**: Payment from successful Operations vary depending on the difficulty and success conditions of the mission.
- **Equipment Store**: Access the store via the bot to purchase:
  - Primary and secondary weapons
  - Weapon attachments (scopes, suppressors, grips)
  - Certain tactical equipment (night vision, specialized grenades)
  - Certain armor and clothing options

:::note
Restricted/Economy-Locked items vary depending on the campaign setting, specialty positions ([MOS](/reference/terms#MOS)), rank, and etc. To find out if your kit is valid, ask a superior ranking Sentinel Member.

- `/balance` - Check your current balance
- `/deposit` - Deposit an amount into the bank. **Note:** You can deposit everything with `/deposit all`.
- `/withdraw` - Withdraw an amount from the bank.
- `/work` - Work for a small payment (once every 5 hours)
- `/item inventoy` - View your purchased items
- `/item info` - You can use this to search for items that are in the arsenals.
- `/item buy` - You can use this to purchase items. **Note:** To purchase, you must have the amount withdrawn from the bank.

:::caution
Some Sentinel Personnel may be observed gambling with the funds they've received from contracts. Such activities are not regulated by any official gambling authority, and aren't recommended. Participate at your own risk.
