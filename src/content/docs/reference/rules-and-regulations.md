## Team Killing
Any team killing during company events is considered intolerable and will be met with disciplinary action if deemed inappropriate or not accidental.

Retaliation for being team killed is deemed inappropriate. If team killed in unsuitable circumstances, simply talk to any command staff present or send a clip on Discord or Xbox for further action.

## Negligent Discharge
When on company time or in the presence of multiple company members, do not discharge your weaponry in a negligent manner. This may include: shooting in the air, shooting the ground, shooting near a teammate, and more. Any negligent firing action may result in discipline. 

We may set up a firing range occasionally; if there is one, feel free to fire in the appropriate area.

## Rules Of Engagement
Rules of engagement will be stated and determined during brief before contracts/operations. ROE must be followed; if disregarded it may have negative effects on the campaign or on the involved party. Ensure you positively identify a target before choosing to engage.

## Chain Of Command
Any units should express concerns or issues with their team leaders before taking it to the executive level. In certain cases where it is not suitable to talk with a certain member in the command structure, it is allowed to take it up a step. Refer to the chain of command channel for more detail.

## Specialty Designations (MOS)
All members up to the rank of Basic Operator can utilize one specialty, and two at the rank of Senior Operator. Most weaponry will be MOS specific which means, as it suggests, they can only be utilized by members who have the MOS (Anti Tank can utilize RPG's only).

This may be overridden in the case of exigent circumstances or emergency; otherwise it is not allowed to take weapons not attached to your specialty.

## Respect And Morality
In the group we respect one another and do not tolerate discrimination based on gender, sexuality, race, religion, etc. If members are deliberately harassing members due to any of these factors, discipline can and will be issued.

## Double Clanning
We don't disallow being in other milsim groups, but if it leads to gross inactivity or issues within the unit with poaching, you may be removed or demoted. Any command staff cannot double clan; if they do, they will be stripped of rank. If you wish to maintain a command position in the group, we prefer your dedication to the group.

## Professionality And Behaviour
If members repetitively ruin and decrease the quality of events and other server activities, they can receive discipline. We are not the most serious group outside of conflict. When we are in conflict, we maintain professionalism and integrity to a degree. Of course, this doesn't mean don't joke or have fun, just don't start making fun of people or the scenario, as well as ruining a serious atmosphere by judging others.
