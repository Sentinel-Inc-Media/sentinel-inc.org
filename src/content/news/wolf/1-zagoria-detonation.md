A massive explosion tore through a major Zagorian military ammunition depot early Friday morning, prompting widespread panic and confusion across the region. The blast, which many initially mistook for a tactical nuclear strike, is now believed to have been the result of a Russian missile barrage as part of the ongoing full-scale invasion of the country.

The explosion occurred just before dawn near the embattled town of Novokrosna, where Zagorian forces had been using Depot 117 as a logistical hub for artillery and armored operations. The site, one of the largest remaining munitions storage facilities in the country, was critical to sustaining defensive operations in the eastern sector of the front line.

Eyewitnesses described a brilliant flash followed by a deafening shockwave that shattered windows and set off car alarms up to 30 kilometers away. A massive plume of fire and smoke rose into the sky, with satellite imagery later confirming a mushroom-shaped cloud visible from orbit — fueling early fears on social media and among civilians that a nuclear weapon had been used.

“I thought we were hit by a nuke,” said one resident in Polana, whose home was damaged by the shockwave. “It felt like the whole earth cracked open.”

Zagorian military officials quickly confirmed that the explosion was caused by a direct strike on the depot, likely using precision-guided munitions. A senior defense source, speaking on condition of anonymity, stated that the scale of the secondary detonations suggested thousands of tons of stored artillery shells, rockets, and anti-tank weapons were incinerated in the blast.

The Zagorian Ministry of Defense issued a statement hours later, emphasizing that no nuclear materials were present at the facility and there was no radiation risk. However, officials acknowledged the psychological impact of the explosion, which came as Russian forces intensified their push into central Zagoria following weeks of grinding urban warfare and missile strikes.

“Depot 117 was a key logistical asset,” said Defense Minister Kiril Dovzhenko in a press briefing. “Its destruction will not break our resistance, but it is a painful loss — and a reminder of the enemy’s willingness to strike deep into our territory.”

At least 50 personnel are confirmed dead, with dozens more wounded or missing. Rescue operations are ongoing, though fires and unstable munitions have hampered efforts.

The strike has also drawn renewed international attention, with seismic sensors in multiple NATO countries initially flagging the detonation as anomalous. Several European air traffic control agencies briefly diverted flights due to uncertainty over the blast’s origin.

Zagorian forces continue to hold defensive lines along key corridors, but analysts warn that deeper strikes like the one on Depot 117 signal a strategic shift in Moscow’s campaign — aimed at crippling the country’s ability to sustain prolonged resistance.

Despite the attack, President Olen Savka addressed the nation Friday night, vowing that the Zagorian people “will not be broken by fear, fire, or force.”
