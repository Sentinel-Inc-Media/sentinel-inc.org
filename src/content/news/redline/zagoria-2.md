In the early hours of Tuesday morning, a missile strike destroyed a residential apartment complex, killing at least 24 civilians and injuring dozens more. The building had been housing families displaced from fighting in western Zagoria.

> “Some of the people in that building had just escaped from the west,” said a Vikhr soldier who assisted in the rescue. “They thought they were safe here. There’s no such thing as a safe zone anymore.”

Rescue teams worked through the night, pulling survivors from the debris.The Zagorian government condemned the strike as a "deliberate attack on civilian life."


**A week later, tragedy struck again in the skies over Zagoria.**

Two Zagorian military helicopters were shot down during a low-altitude flight through contested airspace:

One helicopter was transporting wounded civilians from the western front to a hospital in the east.

- *The second was departing for ammunition and medical supplies to frontline units.* 

- *All crew members aboard both aircraft were killed.*

>“Those pilots had flown that route a hundred times. They knew the risks. Still did it,” said a Vikhr soldier who had served with the fallen crew. “That’s the kind of people we’re losing — not just soldiers, but brothers.”

**Pressure Mounts Across Central and Western Fronts**

These incidents have sent shockwaves through both the central and western fronts, where forces are now stretched thinner than ever. Air support is faltering, and the risk of further civilian casualties remains high.

> “It’s not just about firepower or tactics anymore,” another Vikhr fighter said. “This war is trying to break people. You feel it every time we lose another friend, another building, another piece of what used to be normal.”

Despite the week’s devastation, Spetsgrupa Chornyi Vikhr remains defiant.

> “Every time they hit us, we dig in deeper,” said one soldier. “They think they can bomb us into submission. Let them try.”

For Vikhr and many like them, hope has given way to grit — a cold, clear determination to resist at all costs.

**The Siege Grinds On**
As smoke continues to rise and the wreckage of two helicopters lies scattered across Zagoria, the grim truth remains: the siege is not over. It creeps on, relentless. And this past week, it crept closer to the heart of Zagoria than ever before.
