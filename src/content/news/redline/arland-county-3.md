**ARLAND COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA** — A series of coordinated federal raids early this morning uncovered a horrifying scene in the dense forests of Arland County, as FBI agents,with help of an unnamed military force stormed three compounds belonging to the Church of Revival and Trinity, a controversial religious cult under years of suspicion.

One of the compounds, located deep within the eastern woodland, was found burned and littered with the bodies of at least 14 individuals. According to federal sources, the deceased appeared to have taken part in a **ritualistic mass suicide**, citing symbolic markings, incense remnants, and arranged body positions as initial evidence.

The other two sites were secured without reported fatalities, though several individuals were detained and a cache of weapons and sealed documents were recovered.

The FBI has not released the names of those involved but confirmed that the deceased included both adults and young adults believed to be members of the cult. The motive behind the mass suicide remains unclear, but officials point to the Church’s long-documented obsession with “purification through fire” and end-times prophecy.

> “We discovered a scene consistent with a planned, coordinated ritual event,” said an FBI spokesperson on the ground. “The nature of the site and the items recovered suggest deep ideological preparation.” The FBI spokesperson denied any involvment outside of Official Govermental Forces

Local residents, long uneasy about the Church's presence, expressed shock at the scale of the event.

> “They always kept to themselves,” said one Arland County resident. “But you could hear the drums at night. We knew something wasn’t right.”

The Church of Revival and Trinity has previously been linked to disappearances, underground compounds, and militant-style broadcasts. Today's raid marks the most significant federal action taken against the group to date.

Officials confirmed that the investigation is ongoing, and further arrestsmay follow as agents continue to analyze materials seized during the operation.
