Arland County, North Carolina — What began as a quiet spiritual commune nestled deep in the pine forests of Arland County has become the center of a growing storm. According to leaked reports and a key whistleblower, the Church of Revival and Trinity is now under intense scrutiny following serious allegations of human trafficking, narcotics distribution, and various other criminal enterprises.
The Church, known for its cryptic sermons, militarized compounds, and a mantra that reads “The Awakened Shall Inherit the Ashes,” has expanded steadily across remote sections of the county. Outwardly, the group promotes spiritual purification and rebirth through isolation, fire, and trial. But behind the cloistered fences, disturbing reports tell a different story.

A Voice from Within
A former insider, using the alias “Elias,” spoke to Redline News under strict conditions of anonymity. Elias claims to have spent over five years embedded in the Church’s logistics and transportation arm.
“They preach deliverance, but they deal in suffering,” Elias said. “Young girls were taken. Drugs were moved through backwoods roads. Camps were set up — not for worship, but for breaking people. Meth. Fentanyl. Control.”
The anonymous source alleges that illegal goods were concealed in modified crates known internally as “Deliverance Boxes” and moved across Arland County under the guise of religious supplies.

Alarming Patterns in Local Records
Public records reviewed by Redline News show at least 39 separate incident reports linked to Church properties in Arland County between 2021 and 2024. The reports include gunfire, missing persons, domestic complaints, and unauthorized roadblocks near Church-controlled zones.
Two missing persons cases — both involving teenage girls last seen near a Church compound south of Covewood Hollow — remain unsolved.
Former Arland County Sheriff Tom Dreyfus, who stepped down in 2023, offered only a cryptic statement when contacted by Redline News.
“Not everything that burns is evil,” Dreyfus said. “Some fires are meant to cleanse. The world may not understand, but the faithful walk in flame willingly.”
When asked whether he had ever been affiliated with the Church, Dreyfus ended the call without comment.

The Church Responds
In response to inquiries, a Church representative — communicating via an encrypted channel — denied all allegations, calling the whistleblower “a heretic turned agent of deception.”
“We do not traffic flesh. We cleanse the broken and reclaim the cast-off. You fear the flame because you fear the truth,” the statement read.
It closed with the group’s mantra: “The Awakened Shall Inherit the Ashes.”

Silence and Smoke
Despite growing concerns, the Church continues its rituals undisturbed across multiple properties in Arland County. Locals report hearing drums, chants, and screams echoing from the woods at night — yet few dare to speak on record.
Drone footage captured in April shows heavy patrols, ceremonial fires, and children dressed in red robes moving in line through fenced compounds.
“They think the law can’t touch them anymore,” Elias said. “And maybe they’re right.”

New footage obtained by Redline News shows a forested compound in Arland County, North Carolina, where men in white militia-style uniforms patrol in formation. Chanting can be heard over fire pits, and experts describe the site as “a theocratic war camp hiding in plain sight.”
